## Generative Adverserial Networks 
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook which is a presentation cum toy example for a Generative Adverserial Network (GAN). In the example we take a generator and a discriminator both of which are neural networks with only two hidden layers. We generate a data set wich is multiple sample sets of data points sampled from a gaussian distribution. The discriminator is optimised to discriminate between fake and real data where, fake data is being generated by the generator. The generator on the other is optimised to generate fake data that resembles the real data as closely as possible.
